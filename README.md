> Spawn EIP 1167 minimal proxies with an included initialization step during contract creation.

These contracts demonstrate a technique for initializing and deploying [EIP 1167](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1167) minimal proxies that point to designated logic contracts. Logic contracts should make an initialization function available that only allows it to be called during contract construction (i.e. `assembly { if extcodesize(address) { revert(0, 0) } }`).

## Install
To include Spawner as a dependency in your project:
```
$ yarn add eip1167-spawner
```

To install locally, you'll need Node.js 10+ and Yarn *(or npm)*. To get everything set up:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/0age/Spawner.git
$ cd Spawner
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
```

## Usage
Import Spawner and inherit it on a contract, then call `_spawn` with the desired logic contract and ABI-encoded initialization calldata:
```Solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

import "eip1167-spawner/contracts/Spawner.sol";
import "./MyLogicContract.sol";


contract MyFactory is Spawner {
  function spawnIt() public returns (address spawnedContract) {
    MyLogicContract logic = MyLogicContract(address(...));
    
    bytes memory myInitializationCalldata = abi.encodeWithSelector(
      logic.initialize.selector,
      "argumentOne",
      "argumentTwo"
    );
    
    spawnedContract =  _spawn(
      address(logicContract),
      myInitializationCalldata
    );
  }
}
```

You can also use `_spawnCompact` *(for logic contracts with at least five leading zero bytes or ten zeroes)*, `_spawnOldSchool` *(for deploying with `CREATE` rather than `CREATE2`)*, or `_spawnCompactOldSchool`.

To run tests locally, start the testRPC, trigger the tests, and tear down the testRPC *(you can do all of this at once via* `yarn all` *if you prefer)*:
```sh
$ yarn start
$ yarn test
$ yarn stop
```

PRs accepted gladly - make sure the tests pass. *(Changes to the contracts themselves should bump the version number and be marked as pre-release.)*
